# PLAN-node-express-angular-db
This repo will be use as the planning stage for software development. 
It will contain all the necessary information needed to complete the project 
of creating an RESTful API service using NodeJS, ExpressJS and AngularJS. I plan
on using PostgresSQL as my database and have it exist on a seperate docker container that
will act as a persistent storage.
