# PLANNING 
This repo will be use as the planning stage for software development. 
It will contain all the necessary information needed to complete the project 
of creating an RESTful API service using NodeJS, ExpressJS and AngularJS. I plan
on using MongoDB as my database and have it exist on a seperate docker container that
will act as a persistent storage.

The application idea will be a meal planner that will do a daily tracker, week by week, month by month
of the meals i consume. The nutriotion goals i comleted and other metrics

# NodeJS
Use as the base language for server side programming

# ExpressJS
Use ExpressJS framework to configure the backend and respond to the request/post/update

# AngularJS
User AngularJS with SemanticsUI to provide the basic UI/UX

# MongoDB
Use MongoDB with Mongoose framework as our database
